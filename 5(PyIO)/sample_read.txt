Suppose we have the processing cost per unit at each process i, denoted as Ci, in the supply
chain. This cost is the part of the total processing cost that is associated with the delivery
time. For example, in the case of a manufacturing process, it could be the opportunity cost
of capital tied up with machinery. In addition, if it is a logistics process, then it may rep-
resent the cost of transportation itself. We suppose that the mean processing time for all
potential service suppliers is almost the same but their variance may differ and hence
